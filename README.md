A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that enhances the efficiency of search, insertion, and deletion operations in a sorted list. It consists of multiple layers of linked lists, where each higher layer acts as an express lane for the lists below, allowing for faster traversal. The structure uses randomization to determine the height of each node, which helps maintain balance and ensures that the average time complexity for operations remains logarithmic.
